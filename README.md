#Capstone Project 2: Culture Lab Kombucha


##Project Description

This project is a practice task complete as part of HyperionDev's Web Development Bootcamp. 

It is a single-page, mock e-commerce catalogue/product category page for a kombucha manufacturer called Culture Lab kombucha. The webpage displays each of Culture Labs 6 flavours, offering users the option of purchases a 6-pack or 24-bottle-case.

It is not a functional webpage and is rather an UI demonstration that was aimed to test my knowledge of Bootstrap. The buttons do not function oand the product data was hard-coded.

##Installation instructions
Gain acces to the "Byron Devin-119886" Dropbox file owned by HyperionDev. 

Navigate to the following file "Byron Devin-119886/Web Development Essentials/Task 6/Task6OnlineStore"

Open the catalogue.html file in your browser 

##Usage
The project does not have a real-world use. However, if this were a real catalogue page on a functional e-commerce site, the page woudl be used to:
    1. Display Culture Lab's product range
    2. Provide infomation about each product
    3. Allow customers to add products to their respective carts
        3.1 Act as a landing page for customers who are ready to buy

The project has also given me vital experience working with Bootstrap.

Furthermore, I will develop a costom Culture Lab site aftet this course as a portfolio piece. Potentially, some of this code or some of these ideas could be re-used.
